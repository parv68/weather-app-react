# Weather App React
### I have created a weather app using React.js. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data of a city. The app displays the current temperature, weather description, and a 5-day forecast. The app also allows the user to search for a city and get the weather data for that city.
### Technologies Used: React.js, OpenWeatherMap API, CSS, HTML
